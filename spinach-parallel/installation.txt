SPINACH INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Minimum version of Matlab is R2011a - 64 bit Matlab is preferred with at least 
   4GB of free RAM. The workstations that Spinach was developed on had 12GB of RAM
   and 64GB swap files on PCI-Express solid state disks.

2. Add the following directories (including subdirectories) to the Matlab path
   (Menu/File/Set Path):

       <spinach root>/kernel
       <spinach root>/etc
       <spinach root>/exp

   You may have to allow write access to \toolbox\local\pathdef.m file in your Matlab 
   directory in order to be able to save the updated path file.

3. The best way to get started is to look through the code in the \examples directory. 
   Detailed documentation, including published papers, is available in the \docs directory.
   It is essential that you understand the factors that influence the choice of the basis
   set in Spinach.













=== EXPERT MATTERS ===

1. Sandia Labs' Tensor Toolbox is required for the DMRG/MPS module. It can be downloaded
   from http://csmr.ca.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/

2. Clebsch-Gordan coefficients with L ranks in excess of 2,000 require a bigger Java heap
   size than Matlab's default. The following page
         http://www.mathworks.co.uk/support/solutions/en/data/1-18I2C/index.html
   has the instructi8ons on how to increase the Java heap.

3. To set up a Matlab cluster on Amazon EC2 cloud, follow these instructions:

        1. Start a single 8-core Windows x64 instance without the Amazon firewall.
        2. Change the Administrator password to the one you prefer.
        3. Install Matlab 2011a or later with Distributed Computing Server option.
        4. Run addMatlabToWindowsFirewall.bat file as Administrator.
        5. Switch off Windows firewall.
        6. Run 'mdce install', then 'mdce start' as Administrator.
        7. Stop the mdce service and set it to "Manual" in the service settings.
        8. Set up Spinach and set the paths in Matlab.
        9. Shut down the instance and make an AMI.
       10. Spawn several instances from the AMI, pick a head node and log into it.
       11. Run admincenter.bat, feed it the node addresses and start the mdce services.
       12. Create a JobManager in AdminCenter, start the workers.
       13. From a client instance, connect to the JobManager.

   Please remember that technical support queries on this ought to be directed to MathWorks,
   not us -- they certainly did not make it easy.
