% Simultaneous multi-channel pulse function. Resamples the grids of the input
% waveforms onto a common time grid, generates a unified Liouvillian stack on
% the resulting common grid and applies the resulting propagators to the state
% vector. The pulse centers are aligned in the resulting combined waveform.
% 
% Each nucleus can only appear once on the nucleus list: using e.g. two different
% carbon channels is not allowed.
%
% Input variables:
%
% liouvillian:   the drift Liouvillian
%
% offsets:       [off1 off2 ...]             (Hz, row vector)
% phases:       {[phi1 phi2 ... phiN],...
%                [phi1 phi2 ... phiK]}       (degrees, cell array of row vectors)
% amplitudes:   {[a1 a2 ... aN],...
%                [b1 b2 ... bK]}             (rad/s, cell array of row vectors)
% durations:     [dur1 dur2 ...]             (seconds, row vector)
%
% spins:        {'1H', '13C', ...}           (cell array of strings)

% Had I the heavens’ embroidered cloths,
% Enwrought with golden and silver light,
% The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
% Of night and light and the half light,

% But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
% I have spread my dreams under your feet;
% Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.
