# This wrapper script is intended to be submitted to SLURM to support
# parallel execution.
#
# This script uses the following environment variables set by the MATLAB 
# submit program:
# MDCE_CMR            - the value of ClusterMatlabRoot (may be empty)
# MDCE_MATLAB_EXE     - the MATLAB executable to use
# MDCE_MATLAB_ARGS    - the MATLAB args to use
#
# The following environment variables are forwarded through mpiexec:
# MDCE_DECODE_FUNCTION     - the decode function to use
# MDCE_STORAGE_LOCATION    - used by decode function 
# MDCE_STORAGE_CONSTRUCTOR - used by decode function 
# MDCE_JOB_LOCATION        - used by decode function
