RUNNING JOBS WHEN CLIENT AND CLUSTER SHARE A FILE SYSTEM
========================================================

To run jobs when a shared file system is present between client and the 
cluster machines, the following files are used:

* slurmParallelDecode.m
* slurmParallelSubmitFcn.m
* slurmSimpleDecodeFunc.m
* slurmSimpleSubmitFcn.m
* slurmParallelWrapper.sh
* slurmSimpleWrapper.sh


RUNNING JOBS WHEN CLIENT AND CLUSTER DO NOT SHARE A FILE SYSTEM
===============================================================

To run jobs in the absence of a shared file system between client and 
cluster machines, use the files in the subdirectory "nonshared".
